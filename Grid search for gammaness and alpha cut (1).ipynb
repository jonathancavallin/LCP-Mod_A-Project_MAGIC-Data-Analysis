    "Many of the cases considered return 0 false positives, and thus an \"infintite\" Q value, indicating that we are succeding in our objective. Between these, of course we prefer the case with the highest number of true positives (to have more gamma events selected to work with). However, there are also cases with a single false positive sample and a higher number of true positives. To avoid choosing the best combination of *alpha cut* and *gammaness* solely on the performance on this specific test set, we run the same algorithm on different test sets and choose as best case the one that returns an \"infinite\" Q value more times. In case of ties, we choose the *alpha cut* and *gammaness* that allow to find the higher average number of true positives.   "
