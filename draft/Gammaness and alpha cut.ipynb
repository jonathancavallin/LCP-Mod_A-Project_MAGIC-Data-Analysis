    "We now apply the best model found in the previous part, i.e: the Random Forest, to look for the combination of parameters *gammaness* and *alpha_cut* that maximizes the quality factor *Q*. What we do is label as background (hadrons) all samples with fAlpha greater than the *alpha_cut* value considered; then we apply the best Random Forest classification to the remaining samples, labelling as gammas only the samples with a predicted probability of belonging to class +1 greater than *gammaness*. Then we determine the TPR and FPR to calculate the correspondent Q value.    \n",
    "To avoid choosing the best combination of *alpha cut* and *gammaness* solely on the performance on a specific test set, we run the same algorithm on different test sets and choose as best case the one that returns the highest average Q value over the iterations."
